# Coding exercises 

## Overview
This repo contains coding exercises across various programming langauges. More so to help me document my learning experience towards becoming an AI Engineer and if someone else benefits from the organization of cotnent even better.

Organization of content is based on the order in which I learned the langugages and why I learned them. Python (Easy to use and predominantly used for work), Java (Portability and good for production level code), C++ (high performance computing), JavaScript (Frontend design of applications), & Scala (Distributed computing). In Projects/Building applications one lands up using a combination of languages depending on which phase of the pipeline is being built and what is the need of that phase. Below listed are easy access links to each langauge:
