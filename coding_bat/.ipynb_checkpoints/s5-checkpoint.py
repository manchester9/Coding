"S5.1"
#When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party 
#is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, 
#in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return True if the party with the 
#given values is successful, or False otherwise.
#cigar_party(30, False) → False
#cigar_party(50, False) → True
#cigar_party(70, True) → True



"S5.2"
#You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the 
#result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If 
#speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, 
#the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. 
#Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
#caught_speeding(60, False) → 0
#caught_speeding(65, False) → 1
#caught_speeding(65, True) → 0



"S5.3"
#The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, return True if 
#either one is 6. Or if their sum or difference is 6. Note: the function abs(num) computes 
#the absolute value of a number.
#love6(6, 4) → True
#love6(4, 5) → False
#love6(1, 5) → True

"S5.4"
#You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the 
#stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your 
#date's clothes. The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. 
#If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if 
#either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).
#date_fashion(5, 10) → 2
#date_fashion(5, 2) → 0
#date_fashion(5, 5) → 1



"S5.5"
#Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, sums in the range 10..19 inclusive, are forbidden, 
#so in that case just return 20.
#sorta_sum(3, 4) → 7
#sorta_sum(9, 4) → 20
#sorta_sum(10, 11) → 21



"S5.6"
#Given a number n, return True if n is in the range 1..10, inclusive. Unless outside_mode is True, 
#in which case return True if the number is less or equal to 1, or greater or equal to 10.
#in1to10(5, False) → True
#in1to10(11, False) → False
#in1to10(11, True) → True

"S5.7"
#The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is 
#between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. 
#Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.
#squirrel_play(70, False) → True
#squirrel_play(95, False) → False
#squirrel_play(95, True) → True




"S5.8"
#Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we 
#are on vacation, return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, 
#the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are 
#on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".
#alarm_clock(1, False) → '7:00'
#alarm_clock(5, False) → '7:00'
#alarm_clock(0, False) → '10:00'



"S5.9"
#Given a non-negative number "num", return True if num is within 2 of a multiple of 10. 
#Note: (a % b) is the remainder of dividing a by b, so (7 % 5) is 2. See also: Introduction to Mod
#near_ten(12) → True
#near_ten(17) → False
#near_ten(19) → True
